# vimcmdline: Send lines to interpreter

This plugin sends lines from either [Vim] or [Neovim] to a command line
interpreter (REPL application). Supported file types are Haskell, Julia, Lisp,
Matlab, Prolog, Python, Ruby, JavaScript and sh. The interpreter may run in a
Neovim built-in terminal, an external terminal emulator or in a tmux pane. The
main advantage of running the interpreter in a Neovim terminal is that the
output is colorized, as in the screenshot below, where we have different colors
for general output, positive and negative numbers, and the prompt line:

If running in either a Neovim buitin terminal or a external terminal, the
plugin runs one instance of the REPL application for each file type. If
running in tmux pane, it runs one REPL application for Vim instance.

## How to install

Copy the directories `ftplugin`, `plugin` and `syntax` and their files to your
`~/.vim` or `~/.config/nvim` directory, or use a plugin manager like
[Vim-Plug], [Vundle], [Pathogen], [Neobundle], or other.

## Usage

If you are editing one of the supported file types, in Normal mode do:

  - `<LocalLeader>s` to start the interpreter.

  - `<Space>` to send the current line to the interpreter.

  - `<LocalLeader><Space>` to send the current line to the interpreter and keep the cursor on the current line.

  - `<LocalLeader>q` to send the quit command to the interpreter.

For languages that can source chunks of code:

  - In Visual mode, press:

    - `<Space>` to send a selection of text to the interpreter.

  - And, in Normal mode, press:

    - `<LocalLeader>p` to send from the line to the end of paragraph.

    - `<LocalLeader>b` to send block of code between two closest marks.

    - `<LocalLeader>f` to send the entire file to the interpreter.

## Options

Below are examples of how to set the options in your `vimrc`:

```vim
" vimcmdline mappings
let cmdline_map_start          = "<LocalLeader>s"
let cmdline_map_send           = "<Space>"
let cmdline_map_send_and_stay  = "<LocalLeader><Space>"
let cmdline_map_source_fun     = "<LocalLeader>f"
let cmdline_map_send_paragraph = "<LocalLeader>p"
let cmdline_map_send_block     = "<LocalLeader>b"
let cmdline_map_quit           = "<LocalLeader>q"

" vimcmdline options
let cmdline_vsplit             = 1      " Split the window vertically
let cmdline_esc_term           = 1      " Remap <Esc> to :stopinsert in Neovim terminal
let cmdline_in_buffer          = 1      " Start the interpreter in a Neovim buffer
let cmdline_term_height        = 15     " Initial height of interpreter window or pane
let cmdline_term_width         = 80     " Initial width of interpreter window or pane
let cmdline_tmp_dir            = '/tmp' " Temporary directory to save files
let cmdline_outhl              = 1      " Syntax highlight the output
```

You can also define what application will be run as interpreter for each
supported file type. If you want to do this, create a dictionary called
`cmdline_app`, and add items with the 'filetype' as key and the interpreter as
value, as in the example below:

```vim
let cmdline_app           = {}
let cmdline_app["python"] = "ptipython3"
let cmdline_app["ruby"]   = "pry"
let cmdline_app["sh"]     = "bash"
```

If you are using Neovim, you can use its syntax highlight capabilities to
colorize the interpreter output, and you can customize the colors in your
`vimrc`. The example of customization below is for a terminal emulator that
supports 256 colors (see in Neovim `:h highlight-ctermfg`):

```vim
if &t_Co == 256
    let cmdline_color_input    = 247
    let cmdline_color_normal   =  39
    let cmdline_color_number   =  51
    let cmdline_color_integer  =  51
    let cmdline_color_float    =  51
    let cmdline_color_complex  =  51
    let cmdline_color_negnum   = 183
    let cmdline_color_negfloat = 183
    let cmdline_color_date     =  43
    let cmdline_color_true     =  78
    let cmdline_color_false    = 203
    let cmdline_color_inf      =  39
    let cmdline_color_constant =  75
    let cmdline_color_string   =  79
    let cmdline_color_stderr   =  33
    let cmdline_color_error    =  15
    let cmdline_color_warn     =   1
    let cmdline_color_index    = 186
endif
```

If you prefer that the output is highlighted using you current `colorscheme`,
put in your `vimrc`:

```vim
let cmdline_follow_colorscheme = 1
```
Finally, if you want to run the interpreter in an external terminal emulator,
you have to define the command run it, as in the examples below:

```vim
let cmdline_external_term_cmd = "gnome-terminal -e '%s'"
let cmdline_external_term_cmd = "xterm -e '%s' &"
```

where `%s` will be replaced with the terminal command required to run the REPL
application in a tmux session. Note that `gnome-terminal` does not require an
`&` at the end of the command because it forks immediately after startup.
